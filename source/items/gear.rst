Equipping a shield or weapon requires a short action. The time needed to equip armor depends on the specific armor and is detailed in its description.

Equipped armor, shields, and weapons provide additional options:
- Shields allow a player to completely negate one attack at the cost of 1 EP.
- Armor can block damage, with the number of points blocked determined by the armor's specifications.
- Each weapon type offers unique features, which vary depending on the weapon.

To access these features, a player must have at least rank 1 in the related skill. The number of uses for these features is determined by the skill rank. To reset the uses, a successful repair skill check is required.
