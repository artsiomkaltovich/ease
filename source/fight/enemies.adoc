= Enemies

Enemies are creatures that players can encounter in the game. Each enemy has a difficulty level that players must overcome to perform actions such as attacking, disarming, or scaring them. Some enemies may be immune to certain actions, or the difficulty for specific actions (e.g., scaring) may differ from others (e.g., hitting). However, such exceptions should not be common.
