= Skills

Characters possess various skills, each with a [[skill-value]]*value* ranging from 0 to 7. Skills are 
categorized into five [[rank]]*ranks* as outlined in the table below. Upon reaching a new rank, 
players can select options to enhance their abilities or unlock new actions. For 
instance, by improving the athletic skill, players might gain the ability to disarm 
opponents, knock them prone, or inflict greater damage. See more information <<experience-points,Experience Points>> section.
