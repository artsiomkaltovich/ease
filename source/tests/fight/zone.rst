Zones
=====

The battlefield is divided into distinct zones. A character's position within a zone is significant; zones may contain obstacles such as rocks, bushes, or other terrain features. Positioning behind these obstacles can provide cover from enemies, while being exposed leaves you vulnerable.

Movement within the same zone is considered a short action. Stepping into an adjacent zone from the border of your current zone is also a short action. However, moving to a new zone from any other point within the current zone requires a full action.

Zone Effects
------------

Certain zones may impose movement restrictions, such as slippery or uneven terrain. These zones can increase the cost of movement. For example:

- Characters might need to spend two actions to move a single zone.
- A full action may be required instead of a short action.
- An additional energy point (EP) might need to be expended alongside the action.

Optional Movement Rules
-----------------------

For players seeking a more tactical approach to movement, the battlefield or its zones can be divided into squares, with movement costs calculated as follows:

- Moving to a horizontally or vertically adjacent square costs 2 movement points.
- Moving to a diagonally adjacent square costs 3 movement points.

The movement cost may increase if the square is considered difficult terrain. A creature has a number of movement points equal to its Speed (SPD) attribute.
