Actions
=======

A fight is composed of a series of rounds. During each round, every creature can perform up to two full actions. Additionally, each creature is allowed one short action per round.

Short actions are quick maneuvers, such as stowing a weapon, while full actions involve more complex or time-consuming tasks, such as attacking.

Resolving The Round
-------------------

During the decision phase of a round, players have one minute to decide their actions. During this time,the master determines the actions of non-player characters (NPCs). After this phase, players declare their actions, and the master resolves the round.

Players can specify triggers and conditions for their actions. For example, a player might declare, "I will attack creature A if it moves; otherwise, I will attack creature B." Significant changes in the battlefield, such as a wall collapsing, may alter the planned actions of players and NPCs. The master has the discretion to allow or disallow such changes.
