== Magic Items and Scrolls

Magic items and scrolls are consumable items used to cast spells. A scroll disappears after a single use, while a magic item can be used multiple times. The number of uses for a magic item depends on the user's skill value. To restore its uses, a successful <<recharge>> skill check is required.
