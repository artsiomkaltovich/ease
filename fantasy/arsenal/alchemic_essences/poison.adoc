= Poison

Poison is a type of alchemic essence designed to harm or debilitate living creatures. It is commonly used in traps, weapons, or potions to deliver its toxic effects.

== Effects of Poison

- **Toxic Damage:** When a creature is exposed to poison, it takes poison damage every round the effect persists. Healing is impossible until the poison is neutralized.

- **Enhanced by Frost:** Exposure to frost slows down biological processes in living creatures, doubling the duration of the poison's effects.
