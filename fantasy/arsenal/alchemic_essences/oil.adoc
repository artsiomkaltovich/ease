== Effects of Oil

- **Flammable:** If a character or object is covered in oil, any fire will ignite it. The damage caused by the burning oil decreases by 1 each round until it reaches 0, at which point all the oil is burned.
- **Slippery Surface:** Oil can create slick surfaces, making it difficult for creatures to maintain their footing. Creatures moving across these surfaces are subject to <<hard-to-move, zone effects>>. The master describes which effects are in play when oil is used.
