[[shield-skill]]
= Shield
Proficiency in using shields for defense in combat. The primary skill is <<strength, Strength>>.

When you equip a shield, you gain the following effects:
- [[shielded]]Shielded: Your difficulty for incoming attacks increases by *1*. However, it decreases your <<spd, Speed>>, <<agility, Agility>>, and <<stealth, Stealth>>, as well as any test to cast a spell, by *1*.
- [[raise-shield]]Raise Shield: You can raise your shield as an action. This allows you to block one incoming attack without spending EP. However, blocking an attack this way still uses an <<item-use-token, item use token>>. You can still use <<shield-block, Shield Block>> for yourself during this round if it has been unlocked.

== Rank I
- [[shield-block]]Shield Block: Negate one attack completely at the cost of 1 EP and 1 <<item-use-token, item use token>>. Does not require an action.
- [[guard]]Guard: Take an action to protect an adjacent ally. On success, block all damage they receive from one attack at the cost of 1 EP. You can still use Shield Block for yourself during this round if it has been unlocked.
- [[shield-bash]]Shield Bash: Perform an attack with the shield. On success, the target is pushed away by their size. This is a separate action, so it can be combined with an <<attack, attack>> action.
- Shielded: Penalties for casting spells while equipped with a shield no longer apply to you.
- Shielded: Penalties to Speed, Agility, and Stealth while equipped with a shield no longer apply to you.

== Rank II
- Shield Block: You can now negate attacks from *two* enemies simultaneously at the cost of 1 EP for both.
- Guard: When protecting an adjacent ally, you can block all damage without requiring a skill check.
- Guard: You can protect up to *two* adjacent allies at the cost of 1 EP per ally.
- Guard: You can protect target from *two* simultaneous attacks at the cost of 1 EP for both.
- Shield Bash: During a shield bash, you can choose one of the following effects:
    * Knock the target *prone*.
    * Reduce the target's EP by 1.
- When you equip a shield your difficulty for incoming attacks is increased by *1*.
- Shielded: Your difficulty for incoming attacks is increased by *2*.

== Rank III
- Shield Bash: Your shield bash deals an additional 1 damage point to the target's HP.

== Rank IV
- Shield Bash: Throw your shield at an enemy in the same or an adjacent zone. All other shield bash effects apply. Use a shield skill check instead of a <<throwing, throwing>> check.
