== Why a New System?

There are countless role-playing systems out there, yet debates (and sometimes even holy wars) persist about which one is the best. If you've already found your answer, I'm happy for you! However, I would still like to hear your feedback. If you are one of those still searching, this system is another attempt to satisfy you.

== What's Wrong with Existing Systems?

Some systems are overly complex, requiring extensive rulebooks and significant time to calculate each turn.

Narrative systems can sometimes overwhelm players with options, leading to paralysis during character creation and causing imbalances between player characters during gameplay.

Other systems limit players to a selection of predefined "lunch boxes" instead of offering the freedom to choose from the entire menu.

Most systems use turn-based combat, which is often boring, tedious, and time-consuming. Players are forced to wait for their turn to act, making it difficult to maintain engagement and, more importantly, to cooperate effectively.

== Collaborative Experience

This system is designed to be a collaborative experience between the game master and players. The game master is not an enemy but a guide, storyteller, and referee. The goal is to create a fun and engaging experience for everyone involved.

The options provided below shouldn't be considered a complete list but rather guidelines and examples. The players and game master are encouraged to adapt them to fit the needs of their group, game, and setting. If something doesn't work for you, feel free to change it. If you find a better way to do something, please share it. However, the final choice of what to allow is always up to the game master, who decides whether the selected options match the tone of the game and the setting.

== Philosophy

The following principles guide the design of this system:

- Be as simple as possible, but not simpler.
- We are people, not robots; we don't like calculations.
- Well, adding 12 to 6 is manageable, but adding 7 to 6 is easier.
- Rolling more or fewer dice in the roll is more fun than adding 7 to the result of the roll.
- Summing up 12d6 is not fun.
- Provide choices, not mathematical problems.
- Provide a lot of choices, but don't overwhelm players.
- If something can be removed, remove it.
- If something can't be removed, think again.
- If something is not clear, clarify it.
- If it is still not clear, remove it.
- Prefer the rule of thumb to the rule of law.
- Prefer fun over realism, but not always.
- Prefer realism over complexity.
- Players know their characters better than the master.
- The master knows the world better than the players, but not their characters.
