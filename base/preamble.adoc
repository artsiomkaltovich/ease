== Why a New System?

There are countless role-playing systems out there, yet debates (and sometimes even holy wars) persist about which one is the best. If you've already found your answer, I'm happy for you! However, I would still like to hear your feedback. If you are one of those still searching, this system is another attempt to satisfy you.

== What's Wrong with Existing Systems?

Some systems are overly complex, requiring extensive rulebooks and significant time to calculate each turn.

Narrative systems can sometimes overwhelm players with options, leading to paralysis during character creation and causing imbalances between player characters during gameplay.

Other systems limit players to a selection of predefined "lunch boxes" instead of offering the freedom to choose from the entire menu.

Most systems use turn-based combat, which is often boring, tedious, and time-consuming. Players are forced to wait for their turn to act, making it difficult to maintain engagement and, more importantly, to cooperate effectively.

== Philosophy

- Be as simple as possible, but not simpler.
- We are people, not robots; we don't like calculations.
- Well, adding 12 to 6 is manageable, but adding 7 to 6 is easier.
- Rolling more or fewer dice is more fun than adding 7 to 6.
- Summing up 12d6 is not fun.
- Provide choices, not mathematical problems.
- Provide a lot of choices, but don't overwhelm players.
- If something can be removed, remove it.
- If something can't be removed, think again.
- If something is not clear, clarify it.
- If it is still not clear, remove it.
- Prefer the rule of thumb to the rule of law.
- Prefer fun over realism, but not always.
- Prefer realism over complexity.
- Players know their characters better than the master.
- The master knows the world better than the players, but not their characters.
