[[carrying-capacity]]
Each player can carry a number of items equal to 4 + the rank of Strength + the rank of Endurance. Items must be equipped before use. Each player has the following equipment slots:

- Head
- Body/Chest
- Feet/Boots
- Main Hand
- Off Hand
- Jewelry
- [[item-quick-slot]]A number of quick slots determined by your clothes/armor.

Weapons, shields, armor, clothes, and jewelry are called [[gear]]*gear*. They are equipped in all slots except quick slots. Quick slots are used for one-time items: potions, scrolls, and other consumables. Each quick slot holds one item.

All unequipped items are stored in the backpack. Equipping an item from the backpack or unequipping an item to the backpack requires an action and at least one free hand. Using an equipped item requires an action and a free hand, so using an item directly from the backpack requires two actions and a free hand.
