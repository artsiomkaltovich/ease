= Movement and Battlefield Rules

For players who prefer a more tactical approach to movement, the battlefield or its zones can be divided into squares or cells. Movement costs are then calculated as follows:

- Moving to a horizontally or vertically adjacent square costs 2 movement points.
- Moving to a diagonally adjacent square costs 3 movement points.

The movement cost may increase if the square is considered difficult terrain. A creature has a number of movement points equal to its Speed (SPD) attribute.
