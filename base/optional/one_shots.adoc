= One-Shots

Specific changes can be applied to the rules to simplify and enhance the experience of one-shot adventures. These changes are optional and can be implemented at the discretion of the players and the game master.

== Simplified Experience and Skill Unlocking

Typically, unlocking a skill <<perk, perk>> requires spending XP. In one-shots, the game master may allow players to unlock them without spending XP. However, only one perk can be unlocked per rank. This approach helps streamline and simplify character progression.

For certain stories, experience points can be disregarded entirely, limiting characters to the options available at the start of the adventure.

== Faster Healing, Recovery, and Repair

In one-shot adventures, the game master may choose to accelerate the healing process. Resting effects can be applied after a short break instead of requiring sleep, while sleeping fully restores all spent resources.

Additionally, item and skill uses can be replenished immediately after each battle. This approach makes the game more dynamic and fast-paced, while also helping to balance encounters and enhance the experience of the final fight.
