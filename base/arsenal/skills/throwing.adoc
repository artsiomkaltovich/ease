- Throw: When making a weapon attack, you can target a <<hidden, *hidden*>> but <<undetected, *detected*>> creature with your throw, as long as you are in the same zone as the target. This attack incurs a penalty of *1* die.

== Rank II
- Throw Aim: Take an action to aim, negating the cover penalty of the attack completely.
- Throw Back: When targeted by a thrown attack, you can attempt to catch the object and throw it back at the attacker. Spend 1 EP and make a throwing test against the thrower's test result. This is a <<short-action, short action>>. On success, you may either throw the object back at the attacker as part of this action or keep it for later use. If you throw it back, the original test result is used for the attack.
