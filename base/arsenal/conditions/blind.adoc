[[blind]]
= Blind

Blind creatures cannot see and must perceive the world around them through other means. If the creature's primary sense is sight, other creatures become <<hidden, hidden>> to it.

[[partially-blind]]
== Partially Blind

Partially blind creatures have limited vision and cannot see creatures in other zones. Creatures in other zones become <<hidden, hidden>> to them, but they can still perceive creatures in the same zone. This condition is one degree less severe than the blind condition.
