= Tests

To perform a basic test, roll two six-sided dice (2d6), sum the results, and add the relevant skill value. Compare the total to a difficulty level (N) to determine the outcome.

== Dice Pool

A standard test uses 2d6, but specific conditions may increase or decrease the number of dice rolled. If no dice are rolled (0 dice), the result of the roll is 0, but the skill value is still applied. If the number of dice is negative, the test automatically fails.

== When to Roll and Retrying a Test

The test is necessary when the outcome is uncertain. The game master should declare if the task is too hard to even attempt, as well as allow the completion of easy tasks without rolling.
Both successful and failed tests contribute to the story's progression. For example, failing a lockpick attempt might alert a guard or break the lock, creating new challenges and opportunities. This makes repeated attempts at the exact same action unnecessary. However, alternative actions may be attempted to achieve the same goal, considering the new circumstances.

== Helping from Other Characters

If a player decides to perform a help action, they must describe what they are doing to assist. The game master will determine whether the action is genuinely helpful. If it is, add *one* die to the pool. However, some actions may be ineffective or, in rare cases, harmful, resulting in a *one* die penalty to the pool. Multiple characters can choose to assist with the same action.

== Elongated tests

Most tests are resolved in a single roll, but some tasks may require multiple rolls over several rounds or an extended period. The game master will specify the difficulty level and the number of rolls allowed to complete the task before the first roll.

== Target Several Creatures

If a test targets multiple creatures, one roll is made, unless explicitly stated in the description of the action. Creatures whose difficulty were beaten (see <<enemies, enemies>>) are affected.
