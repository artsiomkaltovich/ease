= Tests

To perform a basic check, roll two six-sided dice (2d6), sum the results, and add the 
relevant skill value. Compare the total to a difficulty level (N) to determine the 
outcome.

== Dice Pool

A standard check uses 2d6, but specific conditions may increase or decrease the number of dice rolled. If no dice are rolled (0 dice), the result of the roll is 0, but the skill bonus is still applied. If the number of dice is negative, the check automatically fails.

== Retrying a Check

Both successful and failed checks contribute to the story's progression, making repeated attempts at the exact same action unnecessary. However, alternative actions may be attempted to achieve the same goal, considering new conditions.

== Helping from Other Characters

If a player decides to perform a help action, they must describe what they are doing to assist. The game master will determine whether the action is genuinely helpful. If it is, add *one* die to the pool. However, some actions may be ineffective or, in rare cases, harmful, resulting in a *one* die penalty to the pool. Multiple characters can choose to assist with the same action.

== Extended Checks

Most checks are resolved in a single roll, but some tasks may require multiple rolls over several rounds or an extended period. The game master will specify the difficulty level and the number of rolls allowed to complete the task before the first roll.

== Target Several Creatures

If a check targets multiple creatures, one roll is made, unless explicitly stated in the description of the action. Creatures whose difficulty were beaten (see <<enemies, enemies>>) are affected.
